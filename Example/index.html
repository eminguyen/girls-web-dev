          For generations people have been arguing what is the best starter
          Pokemon. Is it Charmander or is it Squirtle? This website will compare
          the different features between the Pokemon and help you decide
          which one to start your journey with!

      <p>
        This is Charmander. He is a fire lizard with an orange body, blue eyes,
        and fangs. A fire burns at the tip of his tail. If this flame goes out,
        it's rumored that Charmander will die.

      <p> <b> Why is Charmander the best? </b> </p>
      <ul>

        <li>
          He is a lizard that breathes fire
        </li>

        <li>
          He evolves into a freaking dragon
        </li>

        <li>
          Objectively the coolest looking starter Pokemon
        </li>

      </ul>

      <p> <b> What's wrong with Charmander? </b> </p>
      <ul>

        <li>
        The first two gym leaders you battle are rock and water. You're going to
        get destroyed
        </li>

        <li>
          Can only learn useless HM's like Cut
        </li>

        <li>
          In the anime, Charizard was a real jerk for several episodes
        </li>

      <h2>
      Squirtle

      <p>
      This is Squirtle. He is a blue turtle that spits out water from
      his mouth. His tail curls inward. He will often use his shell in
      battle to protect himself (Unfortunately, Withdraw is the most
      useless move in the video games despite how cool it looks in the
      anime).
    </p>

    <br>
    <br>

    <p> <b> Why is Squirtle the best? </b> </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
      He can match Charmander in coolness when he's in the Squirtle
      Squad

      </li>

        <li>
        He evolves into a giant tortoise with cannons on its back
        </li>

        <li>
        He can learn an actually useful HM - Surf
        </li>

      </ul>

      <p> <b> What's wrong with Squirtle? </b> </p>
      <ul>

        <li>
        He's literally just a blue turtle
