      HTML Introduction
    </p>

    <p>
      HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language.
    </p>

    <p>
      HTML is made up of basic building blocks called elements.
      Elements are made up of tags and content.
    </p>

    <p>
      A tag looks something like the following:
      <br />
      <pre>
        <code>
          &lt;p>
        </code>
      </pre>
      Basically, it is just code that comes between two arrow symbols.
    </p>

    <p>
      Also, you should also know that most tags come in sets of two.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br />
      <pre>
        <code>
          &lt;p> &lt;/p>
        </code>
      </pre>
      Its buddy is called a closing tag.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note: While most tags have a buddy, not all do. We will go over some later.
    </p>

    <p>
      Content in most cases is just text.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br />
      <pre>
        <code>
          &lt;p> Example Text &lt;/p>
        </code>
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      The above code will look produce something that looks like this:
    </p>

    <p>
      Example Text
    </p>

    <p>
      Notice that the tags disappear and the content stays. In this case, the
      content was placed between paragraph tags. These tags basically just display
      text on the screen plainly. Most of the content you've seen so far has been
      displayed using just paragraph tags (Aside from the code examples). We will
      explore many more types of tags soon!
