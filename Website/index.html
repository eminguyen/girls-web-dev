      IEEE Girl's STEM Fair 2018 Web Development Workshop
    </p>

    <p>
      Today we will be learning how to make a website.
      There are many computer languages that are used in web development
      but the most popular are HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
      The first part of this workshop will focus on the language HTML.
    </p>

    <p>
      Follow along with the instructors as they guide you to make
      your very own website. Also, an important page will be
      <a href="https://github.com/eminguyen/stemworkshop">https://github.com/eminguyen/stemworkshop.</a>
      Here, you can find an Example website under the Example folder, and if you're interested,
      the code for the website you are reading in the Website folder. If you're ever lost,
      feel free to open up the Example website or call an instructor over.
